    <h2>First blog post: 6th January 2018</h2>
    <p>Welcome to my first ever blog post! Though I’m writing this in 2019 ( just before we return back to class tomorrow from our Christmas holiday), I want to dedicate this post to everything we have covered in 2018 so far... </p>

We started on the 5th of November and have already completed modules one and half of module two. It has been intense but so much fun!</p>

<p>Our first day was full of introductions and presentations from various figures within BT, all of whom made us feel welcome and excited about the months to come. The day flew by and we all went for dinner nearby at The Drift Restaurant. </p>

In the past two months, we have covered HTML/CSS/JavaScript/JQuery/Git and Python. We have completed projects which include making websites for Women in Tech using HTML and CSS,  a Rock, Paper, Scissors game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, a group project on Mobile Data Plans using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and, finally, this portfolio website!

<p>For module 2 we have completed exercises that use Python to calculate data plans, an OOP project to create moving shapes and a group project where Mabel and I created a pizza ordering game which calculates the calories of your final order.</p>

<p>Outside of teaching, we have had presentations from the teams at all four locations: Ipswich, Cardiff, Belfast and Bristol. We also got to visit Adastral Park for a day in Ipswich and spend a weekend in Belfast. Both trips were informative and fun, and it was great to explore the city of Belfast to get a proper feel for the location. </p>

<p>Before I knew it, it was the final day before our Christmas holiday and on this day we covered teaching content, had time to work on our OOP Christmas project and opened our Secret Santa presents as a class. </p>

<p>I spent my two week break finalising my deep learning project as part of another online course I was also completing which was focused on building a classifier for flowers using Pytorch. Aside from this course, I was completing a Data Foundations Nanodegree with Udacity and completed four projects which used SQL, Tableau and Excel. The courses were both enjoyable and informative - I met great people during the study groups for them and got to complete interesting projects.</p>

<p>It has been a rewarding time so far and I’m ready and excited for the next half of the course! :)</p>
